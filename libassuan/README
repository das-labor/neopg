    This is a general purpose IPC library which is for example used
    GnuPG, GPGME and some other software.

    See COPYING.LIB on how to share, modify and distribute the
    software itself (LGPLv2.1+) and COPYING for the documentation
    (GPLv3+).

    Notes for Windows CE:
    ----------------------

    Libassuan supports WindowsCE (tested with WindowsMobile 6.5).  To
    install it, copy libassuan-0.dll into a location where DLL are found
    and install the included gpgcedev driver: First copy "gpgcedev.dll"
    into the root directory, second run the included program gpgcemgr on
    the device: "gpgcemgr --register".  This creates the necessary
    registry keys.  In case the copy step fails, the driver may still be
    in use: Close all applications using that driver, run "gpgcemgr
    --deactivate" to deactivate the running driver and try again.

    Registry keys created by "gpgcemgr --register" are:

       Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\dll    -> "gpgcedev.dll"
       Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\prefix -> "GPG"
       Drivers\\GnuPG_Device\Index  -> 1      (dword)
