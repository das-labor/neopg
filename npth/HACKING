* No ChangeLog files

  Do not write ChangeLog files for NPTH.  We put change information
  only in the GIT commit log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file
  from logs at "make dist" time.  As such, there are strict
  requirements on the form of the commit log messages.


* Commit log requirements

  Your commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the
  second line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually
  ChangeLog-style entries for all affected files.  However, it's fine
  -- even recommended -- to write a few lines of prose describing the
  change, when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of
  the big picture.  Omit the leading TABs that you're used to seeing
  in a "real" ChangeLog file, but keep the maximum line length at 72
  or smaller, so that the generated ChangeLog lines, each with its
  leading TAB, will not exceed 80 columns.
